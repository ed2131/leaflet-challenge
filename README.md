# Earthquake and Tectonic Plate Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes real-time earthquake data and tectonic plate boundaries on an interactive map. It's designed to illustrate the relationship between seismic activities and tectonic plates, using data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and tectonic plate boundaries data from the Fraxen GitHub repository.

## Features
- **Real-time Earthquake Visualization**: Displays earthquake data from the past week, including magnitude and depth.
- **Tectonic Plate Boundaries**: Showcases the global tectonic plate boundaries.
- **Interactive Map**: Users can click on earthquake markers to get more information about each earthquake.
- **Layer Controls**: Toggle between different layers to view either earthquakes, tectonic plates, or both.
- **Base Map Selection**: Choose from different base maps for different visual perspectives.

## Data Sources
- Earthquake data is fetched from the [USGS API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).
- Tectonic plates data is obtained from [Fraxen's tectonicplates GitHub repository](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates).

## Technologies Used
- [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/): An open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For structuring and styling the web page.
